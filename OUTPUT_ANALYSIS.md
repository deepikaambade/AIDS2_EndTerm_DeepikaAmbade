The file size progression shows:
1. **Simple Models**: Large files with white noise (low information density)
2. **Improved Models**: Smaller files with basic structure (more efficient encoding)
3. **Advanced Models**: Larger files with complex structure (high information density)

### MSE Performance Evolution

The MSE values show:
- **GRU models** consistently outperformed RNN and LSTM at each stage
- **Advanced models** generally achieved lower MSE than simpler versions
- **Advanced GRU** achieved the lowest overall MSE (0.047952)

### Subjective Quality Evolution

| Stage | RNN | LSTM | GRU |
|-------|-----|------|-----|
| Simple | White noise | White noise | White noise |
| Improved | Rhythmic noise | Beat patterns | Rhythmic patterns |
| Advanced | Structured audio | Coherent sections | Natural continuation |

## Listening Guide

When listening to the output files, pay attention to:

1. **Tonal Consistency**: How well the prediction maintains the pitch and harmonic content of the original
2. **Rhythmic Continuity**: Whether the rhythm and tempo are preserved
3. **Natural Transitions**: Smoothness of transitions between segments
4. **Structural Coherence**: Whether the overall structure makes musical sense
5. **Artifacts**: Presence of clicks, pops, or unnatural sounds

## Conclusion

The evolution from simple to advanced models demonstrates clear improvements in output quality:

1. **Simple Models**: Produced primarily noise with minimal structure
2. **Improved Models**: Added basic structure and some musical elements
3. **Advanced Models**: Created realistic continuations with natural transitions

The GRU model consistently outperformed the others at each stage, with the advanced GRU producing the most realistic and natural-sounding audio continuations. This aligns with GRU's theoretical advantages in capturing both short-term and long-term dependencies while being computationally efficient.

The progression in output quality demonstrates how increasingly sophisticated audio analysis techniques can improve prediction quality without requiring deep learning frameworks.
